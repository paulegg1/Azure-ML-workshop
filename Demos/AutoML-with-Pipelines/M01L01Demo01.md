# AutoML with Pipelines

## Introduction 

This demo shows how to run a sample automl task with pipelines on Azure ML Dataset.

## Objectives 

In this demo we will:
-	Use a car price dataset which contains price prediction information for automobiles
-	This dataset is split into train, validate, and test subsets and will be uploaded as MLTable data assets to Azure Machine Learning Workspace
-	Build a pipeline that has a data preparation step, an automl task for training, and also register the model 


## Estimated Time 

30 minutes 

## Scenario

Before executing this demo, there are several assets associated with this demo. The .ipynb notebook, the AzureML Pipelines with AutoML notebook, is used to show how  to construct a pipeline of steps in the modeling workflow and use AutoML to build a regression model.

===

## Tasks

1.	Load Azure Machine Learning, with your login
2.	Upload the AutoML-Regression-Car-Pricing-in-Pipeline.ipynb notebook into Azure ML workspace.
3.	Execute the steps in the notebook
4.	Navigate between Machine learning workspace experiment and the code, once the pipeline is submitted to look at the what the UI experience is like compared to python SDK

### Congratulations!

You have successfully completed this exercise and the demo. You can move to the next demo.
